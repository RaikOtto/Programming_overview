				Three different aspects of the gender distribution among scientists are investigated â€“ 
				the proportion of female and male authorships and authors in each country, the evolution 
				of the gender proportions over time as well as the number of citations male and female 
				authors receive. Details about the data and the methods are described in the FAQ. If you
